        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I love to watch entertainment shows, mostly wrestling. Some say that wrestling is fake 
        but to me its more of a performance art combined with athletics I've been watching professional wrestling since I was 9 years old I became interested into their storylines.
        I also love to play video games, such as mobile legends, call of duty, and many more.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I also love to hang out with my friends that are close to me and knows my humor well. My favorite food would be pancit, any kind of pancit you name it.
        I also love to walk around the neighborhood and explore new places. I previously started my jogging journey 8 months ago and it stopped because of college, 
        I plan to start it again when the finals semester ends.
